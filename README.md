# Spring Boot Learning

# ✅ **Spring Boot Project Structure Breakdown**

#### 📁 `demo` (Project Root)
This is your main project folder. It contains configuration and build-related files.

#### 📁 `src/main/java/com/example/demo`
Your main Java code goes here.

1. **`DemoApplication.java`**  
   - This is the main entry point of your Spring Boot application.
   - It contains the `main()` method.
   - It auto-configures the embedded **Tomcat server** and starts the application.

2. **`controller/` (package)**  
   - Contains classes that handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   - ✅ `UserController.java`  
     Handles API endpoints for `User`. It maps URLs to service methods.

3. **`model/` (package)**  
   - Contains the **entity classes** that map to your database tables.
   - ✅ `User.java`  
     Represents the `User` table. Fields in this class should match the column names of the table (if using JPA annotations like `@Column`, matching isn't strictly necessary).

4. **`repository/` (package)**  
   - Contains interfaces that extend Spring Data JPA repositories.
   - ✅ `UserRepository.java`  
     You don't need to write SQL queries manually. This handles database interactions like saving, deleting, finding users automatically using method names.

#### 📁 `src/main/resources`

1. **`application.properties`**
   - Contains configuration: DB URL, username, password, port, logging levels, etc.
   - For example:
     ```properties
     spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/demo
     spring.datasource.username=postgres
     spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
     ```

2. **`static/`**
   - Holds static web content: `HTML`, `CSS`, `JS` files.
   - These are served as-is if you have a UI (not used for REST APIs directly).

3. **`templates/`**
   - For server-side rendering with Thymeleaf or FreeMarker.
   - Not needed for REST API projects (can ignore for now).

---

#### 📁 `target/`
- Auto-generated by **Maven** when you build your project.
- Contains compiled `.class` files, your `.jar` file, etc.
- You **don’t modify** anything in here manually.

---

#### 📄 `pom.xml`
- **Project Object Model** file for Maven.
- Defines dependencies, plugins, Java version, Spring Boot version, etc.
- For example:
  ```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
  </dependency>


## Day 1
- Set up the environment
- Studied a few annotations:
  - `@RestController`
  - `@GetMapping`
 
## Day 2
- Studied a few annotations
  ```
  @SpringBootApplication→
  @RestController
  @RequestMapping
  @Autowired
  @GetMapping(“/{id}”)
  @PostMapping
  @PutMapping(“/{id}”)
  @DeleteMapping(“/{id}”)
  @Repository
  ```
- Installed postman and testing the api and made crud api

## Day 3
- Studied the file structure of springboot
